RETAKE_Analysis:
This repository contains the R code and data required to reproduce the findings from the microbial analysis of the RETAKE experiment conducted on Helgoland in Spring 2023.

Repository Structure:
The repository is divided into four sections. Each section can be viewed independently. All necessary files for the code in each section are provided within the same folder as the R code.

Instructions:
To use the code, you need to adjust the working directory in the setwd() function in each R script to the path where the R script was downloaded.

Usage:
Download the repository.
Open the R script you want to run.
Modify the setwd() line to set the working directory to the location of the downloaded R script.
Run the script to reproduce the analysis.
Enjoy:)!

Edit: I uploaded 2 new R-Markdown files into the Ecological analysis and the Cellcount folders. These represent newer versions of the analysis. Feel free to ignore the older versions of the R-code. I want to keep them so the workflow is reconstructable.
